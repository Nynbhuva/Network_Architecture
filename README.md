# Network_Architecture
IT infrastructure design
I designed this network topology as a project work for final exam.
The main role was to Connect Computers, Switches, Routers, Printers and Servers with each others, Get internet connectivity, Create subnets, Setup VLANs, and assign IP addresses correctly (Mannually or DHCP as per company's requirement).
