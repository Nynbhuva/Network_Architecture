IT infrastructure design

I designed this network topology as a Final project.

A corporate firm wants to start a new business at two locations and needs to set up proper IT network infrastructure for internet connectivity. It's important to ensure that the network infrastructure is properly set up to support the company's IT needs.
I designed a hub-and-spoke topology, where the ISP router is connected to Office Site 1, and Office Site 2 is using the internet through Site 1. This is a common design for connecting multiple sites in a network.

There are five departments in the company such as IT, Management, Finance, Marketing and Operations. The main role was to Connect Computers, Switches, Routers, Printers and Servers with each others, Get internet connectivity, Create subnets, Setup VLANs, and assign IP addresses.
Assigning IP addresses can be done manually or through a DHCP server, depending on the company's requirements. It's important to ensure that IP addresses and VLANs are assigned correctly to avoid conflicts and ensure proper connectivity.

The network is properly implemented and tested to ensure that it is functioning correctly
